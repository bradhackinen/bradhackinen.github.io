Research Statement

I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in Political Economy, Environmental, and Public Economics. I use novel data to learn about how firms interact with government. I hope to contribute to policy debates on anti-trust, corporate philanthropy, lobbying, and the political feasibility of different environmental policies. This broad area of research has long been of interest to economists, but is usually constrained by the scarcity of good data. However, as governments and other institutions digitize their processes a new frontier is opening up to expand our knowledge.

I have developed expertise and tools for collecting digitized documents and organizing them into structured data, as well as machine learning techniques for extracting quantitative information from raw text. This allows me to take large collections of potentially messy and disorganized documents and construct useful measures for analysis.

My largest project so far has been to construct a very large database of tens of thousands of Federal Register documents linked to millions of comments submitted to regulators by individuals and interest groups under the formal notice-and-comment process of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) of 1946. This data allows me to examine how regulations were developed, who submitted comments at each stage, what those comments said, and how the regulator responded in the final rule. It is unique and valuable in a number of ways. First, it is a window into federal rule making in the US, which is incredibly important in determining economic policy, but difficult to study at scale because of its complexity. Second, the fact that the content of comments to regulators are fully observed is unique among lobbying datasets - it allows an unprecedented look at the messages interest groups use to pursuade. Third, the APA requires that regulators provide a proposed version of regulatory changes for comment and address the arguments in the final rule. This means that there is a record of the regulation in different stages of development, and furthermore, discussion by the regulator about how the changes related to the content of messages received from firms and other interest groups.

Making full use of this data requires natural language processing. To that end, I have also developed expertise in machine learning techniques for extracting quantitative information from raw text. -->

My job market paper _Hall of Mirrors: Corporate Philanthropy and Strategic Advocacy_ (with Mariane Bertrand, Matilde Bombardini, Ramond Fisman and Francesco Trebbi) links my regulation comments dataset to data collected by my co-authors on charitable giving by corporations. I constructed similarity measures between the contents of comments from corporations, comments from donation recipients, and the regulator's discussion of the comments in the final rule. We report three sets of findings that are consistent with the view that corporations make strategic use of such donations, and grantee non-profits comment in ways that favor their benefactors. First, we document that non-profits are systematically more likely to comment on the same regulation as a corporation shortly after receiving money from that corporation. Second, when a corporation comments on a rule, the comments by non-profits to whom it recently contributed are closer in content similarity to the corporation's comments than to those submitted by other non-profits. Third, when a corporation comments on a proposed rule, the regulator's discussion of the final rule appears more similar to that corporation's comment when non-profits to which the corporation gave money also comment on that rule.

Like many economists, I am interested in understanding how to improve public policy.

We want to understand what policies are feasible, which are efficient, and what unintended effects might result. However, I am also concerned about how policies are selected, and the possibility of feedback effects from economic policy to the political system. While economists have long been interested in how firms and interest groups can help to shape policy, there is, I beleive, a resurgance of interest in this topic driven by new tools and data.


new tools and data associated with internet access and high-power computing make this an exciting time to revisit the topic.

My job market paper presents a set of empirical findings relevant for the study of information and strategic advocacy in policymaking. Politicians and regulators rely on formal and informal processes of communication with market participants. Some of such counterparties are for-profit corporations whose biases (as well as expertise) may be known, while others are non-profit entities whose stance may be more neutral and could in principle provide unbiased information to policy makers. Through the use of detailed tax return information for the charitable arms of large U.S. corporations we recover a large set of grants awarded to non-profits who participate in the procedurally required public commentary phase of rule making. We report three sets of circumstantial findings that are consistent with the view that corporations make strategic use of such donations, and grantee non-profits comment in ways that favor their benefactors. First, we document that non-profits are systematically more likely to comment on the same regulation as a corporation shortly after receiving money from that corporation. Second, when a corporation comments on a rule, the comments by non-profits to whom it recently contributed are closer in content similarity to the corporation's comments than to those submitted by other non-profits. Third, when a corporation comments on a proposed rule, the regulator's discussion of the final rule appears more similar to that corporation's comment when non-profits to which the corporation gave money also comment on that rule.

This paper studies the process of regulatory rulemaking that followed the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. One of the largest regulatory interventions in the U.S. financial system since the the Great Depression, the Dodd-Frank Act saw an unprecedented involvement by large and small depository institutions, nondepository financial institutions and nonprofits vis-a-vis all main financial regulatory agencies. The statute, 848 pages long, included 398 rulemaking requirements directed to financial regulators, individually or jointly. In the first five years since enactment, finalized rules run around 19,000 pages. We follow each regulatory stream from initial proposal to its final version. Using detailed commentary and meeting information with regulators regarding each rulemaking stream, this paper investigates which banks exerted the largest influence in shaping the final rules and which elements of the law were most effectively neutered and modified, and how. Case studies for the Volcker Rule and Credit Risk Retention are also offered.

I am interested in expanding the set of outcomes that economists can consider when they analyze policy.



Economists are often motivated by "policy relevance". We want to understand what policies are feasible, which are efficient, and what unintended effects might result. However, the analysis that economists perform usually takes policy as exogenous. I am concerned about the endogeneity of policy to economic outcomes. I some sense there is a parallel with the move from partial equilibrium to general equilibrium. When we consider the fact that prices will change as a result of firm decisions, we can get very different policy effects. In the same way, I beleive we will come to different policy recommendations when we understand how policies change
