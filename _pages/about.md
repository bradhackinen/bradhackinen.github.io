I am an assistant professor at [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/).

I am an applied micro-economist working in the areas of political economy, environmental economics, and public economics.

My job market paper is available [here](https://bradhackinen.ca/files/BradHackinen_JMP.pdf).

The library of tools that I have developed for my job market paper is available [here](https://bradhackinen.ca/tools/). The link also includes data visualization and natural language processing tools that I am developing for a set of papers with my co-authors.

My research interests include applied micro-economics problems in the areas of regulation, anti-trust, corporate influence, and lobbying, as well as developing and applying new techniques for text analysis and natural language processing. I am motivated by applications in US environmental and financial regulation, but my research applies more broadly.
