I am an assistant professor at [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/).

My research interests include applied microeconomics problems in the areas of regulation, rulemaking, corporate influence, and lobbying, as well as developing and applying new techniques for text analysis and natural language processing in empirical research.
