I'm a PhD job market Candidate in Economics at the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/). My primary field is Political Economy, and I study corporate influence and lobbying.

I work with messy data, and I have developed expertise in a set of skills that are commonly labelled "data science": web scraping, machine learning, and text analysis. I'm excited about sharing my knowledge (and [tools!](https://github.com/bradhackinen?tab=repositories)) with students and researchers.

My job market paper studies how corporations use charitable donations to influence what information non-profits provide to federal regulators in the US. I'm also working on using text analysis to measure how regulators change the design of regulations in response to public comments from interest groups, and building spatial models of interest group ideology from nonstandard, high-dimensional data like text samples.

I will be available for interviews at the 2018 CEEE and at the 2019 AEA/ASSA meetings.

decision makers. We collect hundreds of thousands of public comments submitted to federal regulators in the US, and show that non-profits are more likely to comment on the same regulation as a corporation when they receive a donation, and that the content of those comments are more similar to the donor's comment than a random comment pair.




I love to share my skills and tools with other students and researchers.
