I am an assistant professor at [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/).

My research interests include applied micro-economics problems in the areas of regulation and rulemaking, corporate influence and lobbying, as well as developing and new techniques for applying text analysis and natural language processing in empirical research.
