__This page is under construction.__

I'm a PhD job market Candidate in Economics at the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/). My primary field is Political Economy, and I study corporate influence and lobbying.

My [job market paper](https://bradhackinen.ca/files/bradhackinen_JMP.pdf) studies how corporations use charitable donations to influence what information non-profits provide to federal regulators in the US. I'm also working on using text analysis to measure how regulators change the design of regulations in response to public comments from interest groups.

I work with messy data, and I have developed expertise in a set of skills that are commonly labelled "data science": web scraping, machine learning, and text analysis. I'm excited about sharing my knowledge (and [tools!](https://github.com/bradhackinen?tab=repositories)) with students and researchers.

I will be available for interviews at the 2018 CEEE and at the 2019 AEA/ASSA meetings.
