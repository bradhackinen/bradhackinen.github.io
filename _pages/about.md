I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/).

I am an applied micro-economist working in the areas of political economy, environmental economics, and public economics.

My job market paper is available [here](https://bradhackinen.ca/files/BradHackinen_JMP.pdf).

The library of tools that I have developed for my job market paper is available [here](https://bradhackinen.ca/tools/). The link also includes data visualization and natural language processing tools that I am developing for a set of papers with my co-authors.

My research interests include applied micro-economics problems in the areas of corporate influence and lobbying, regulation, and anti-trust. I am motivated by applications in US environmental and financial regulation, but my research applies more broadly.

I will be available for interviews at the 2018 CEEE and at the 2019 AEA/ASSA meetings.
