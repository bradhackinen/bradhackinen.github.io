I have built a number of software tools to support my research. All are functional, though the documentation is in varying stages of completion. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:bradhackinen@gmail.com) if you want more information.

**[nama](https://github.com/bradhackinen/nama)**\
Nama (NAme-MAtcher) is a powerful tool for matching organization names in very large datasets. It integrates multiple types of fuzzy matching, including a novel neural network algorithm for quickly finding potential matches, and provides tools for reviewing, modifying, and iteratively improving matches.

**[frdocs](https://github.com/bradhackinen/frdocs)**\
An interface for collecting and parsing Federal Register documents.
