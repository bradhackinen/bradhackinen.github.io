### Hall of Mirrors: Corporate Philanthropy and Strategic Advocacy
_Marianne Bertrand, Matilde Bombardini, Raymond Fisman, Brad Hackinen, and Francesco Trebbi_

_Abstract:_ Designing good economic policy requires good information. Non-profit organizations provide an important source of expertise that is, on the surface, unbiased by self-interest. Unfortunately, anecdotes suggest that information provided by non-profits can be swayed by donations from corporations. We examine corporate influence on non-profits in a setting where we can look for systematic patterns in the positions taken by non-profits and how those positions relate to donations.

In the US, federal regulators follow a formal notice-and-comment process that allows individuals and organizations to provide feedback on proposed regulatory changes. We construct a new dataset that links thousands of public comments submitted to federal regulators in the US to data on donations from major corporations to non-profit institutions. We find that many non-profits that comment on regulations also receive donations from corporations that comment on the same regulations. Furthermore, a given corporation-non-profit pair is more likely to comment on the same regulation after the corporation has recently donated to then non-profit, and the comments that non-profits submit are then more similar to the comment submitted by their donor corporation than a random corporation-non-profit pair.

We interpret these patterns as evidence that non-profits are willing to alter their commenting behavior in response to donations and that corporations use this fact to strategically advance their interests in regulatory policy.

### Who do regulators listen to? Measuring lobbying influence in the notice-and-comment process
_abstract:_ Lobbying by special interests is ubiquitous in US politics. Disclosure requirements provide detailed information on (reported) expenditures, timing, and topics. But the _content_ of lobbying messages are almost always hidden, making it very difficult to measure the effect of lobbying or the relative influence of different groups.

We analyze the content of lobbying messages in a setting where messages from interest groups to policymakers are fully observed. Under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), all US Federal agencies are required to provide proposed versions of regulatory changes (“Proposed Rules”) for public review, and accept public comments on those proposals. We consider two outcome measures: How agencies respond to the key arguments in comments in the discussion of the final rule, and how much the legal text of the regulation changes between the proposed and final version. By matching regulator discussion to individual comments, coding the sentiment of regulator discussion, and comparing this sentiment to change in the legal text we are able to identify which organizations are particularly effective at influencing regulatory policy.
