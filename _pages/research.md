### Hall of Mirrors: Corporate Philanthropy and Strategic Advocacy
_(with Marianne Bertrand, Matilde Bombardini, Raymond Fisman, and Francesco Trebbi)_

_Abstract:_ This paper presents a set of empirical findings relevant for the study of information and strategic advocacy in policymaking. Politicians and regulators rely on formal and informal processes of communication with market participants. Some of such counterparties are for-profit corporations whose biases (as well as expertise) may be known, while others are non-profit entities whose stance may be more neutral and could in principle provide unbiased information to policy makers. Through the use of detailed tax return information for the charitable arms of large U.S. corporations we recover a large set of grants awarded to non-profits who participate in the procedurally required public commentary phase of rule making. We report three sets of circumstantial findings that are consistent with the view that corporations make strategic use of such donations, and grantee non-profits comment in ways that favor their benefactors. First, we document that non-profits are systematically more likely to comment on the same regulation as a corporation shortly after receiving money from that corporation. Second, when a corporation comments on a rule, the comments by non-profits to whom it recently contributed are closer in content similarity to the corporation's comments than to those submitted by other non-profits. Third, when a corporation comments on a proposed rule, the regulator's discussion of the final rule appears more similar to that corporation's comment when non-profits to which the corporation gave money also comment on that rule.

### Lobbying the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010
_(with Marianne Bertrand, Matilde Bombardini, and Francesco Trebbi)_

_abstract:_ This paper studies the process of regulatory rulemaking that followed the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. One of the largest regulatory interventions in the U.S. financial system since the the Great Depression, the Dodd-Frank Act saw an unprecedented involvement by large and small depository institutions, nondepository financial institutions and nonprofits vis-a-vis all main financial regulatory agencies. The statute, 848 pages long, included 398 rulemaking requirements directed to financial regulators, individually or jointly. In the first five years since enactment, finalized rules run around 19,000 pages. We follow each regulatory stream from initial proposal to its final version. Using detailed commentary and meeting information with regulators regarding each rulemaking stream, this paper investigates which banks exerted the largest influence in shaping the final rules and which elements of the law were most effectively neutered and modified, and how. Case studies for the Volcker Rule and Credit Risk Retention are also offered.
