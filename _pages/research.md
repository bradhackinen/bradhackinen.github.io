## Job Market Paper
### [Hall of Mirrors: Corporate Philanthropyand Strategic Advocacy](http://bradhackinen.ca/files/bradhackinen_JMP.pdf)
_Marianne Bertrand, Matilde Bombardini, Raymond Fisman, Brad Hackinen, and Francesco Trebbi_

Designing good economic policy requires good information. Non-profit organizations provide an important source of expertise that is, on the surface, unbiased by self-interest. Unfortunately, anecdotes suggest that information provided by non-profits can be swayed by donations from corporations. We examine corporate influence on non-profits in a setting where we can make a plausible claim of identifying a causal relationship between donations and advocacy for corporate interests.

In the US, federal regulators follow a formal notice-and-comment process that allows individuals and organizations to provide feedback on proposed regulatory changes. We construct a new dataset that links hundreds of thousands of public comments submitted to federal regulators in the US to data on donations from major corporations to non-profit institutions. We find that many non-profits that comment on regulations also receive donations from corporations that comment on the same regulations. Furthermore, a given corporation-non-profit pair is more likely to comment on the same regulation after the corporation has recently donated to then non-profit, and the comments that non-profits submit are then more similar to the comment submitted by their donor corporation than a random corporation-non-profit pair.

We interpret these patterns as evidence that non-profits are willing to alter their commenting behavior in response to donations and that corporations use this fact to strategically advance their interests in regulatory policy.
